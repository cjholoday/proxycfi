Timeline:
    1. calls into "basic" shared libraries work. "basic" shared libraries
       do not have function pointer calls. 
    2. The verifier is run after the loader is finished
    3. Function pointer call support added for shared libraries
    4. PLT entries are fixed up at load time so that the calls are direct

Responsibilities
----------------
converter
    (1) Generate a dummy SLT trampoline. Entries contain a relative jump back 
        to the function they are serving. This allows us to associate symbols
        with trampoline entries. The trampolines will be changed to point to 
        SLT entries at load time
    (1) Generate an empty trampoline info table that is an array corresponding 
        to the SLT trampoline table. Each array element will eventually be filled
        with the symbol table index of the trampoline's associated symbol. For now,
        the array elements are left empty until cdi-ld fills them in
    (1) write null 4 byte addresses before RLT entries. These will be filled 
        to contain the addresses of each RLT entry's associated PLT return 
        address
    (3) expand the SLT trampoline to hold entries for fptr sleds. 
    (3) Create a .typestrtab section, which has its types lexicographically sorted

cdi-ld
    (1) Build a global symbol table which maps (symbol name string -> symbol object)
        for symbols of all code objects. Symbol objects will be of the form:

    class GlobalSymbol: 
        def __init__(self):
            self.name = ''      # symbol name
            self.sl = None      # shared library. 'None' for executable syms
            self.mult = 0       # multiplicity: how many code objects call this sym

        All fields should be filled by the time the symbol table is considered 'built'
        Construction of the global symtab will be done by looking through each
        code object's symtab. The Multiplicity for a given symbol is incremented 
        each time it is found as an undefined symbol in a code object. Symbols 
        will often be found undefined before they are constructed properly. In
        that case, a dummy symbol object will be created, which will have only the
        multiplicity filled out

        The number of incomplete syms will be recorded at all times. This can be
        used to check if the symbol table has been truly completed

        invariant: multiplicity of the executable's symbols should always be 0

    (1) Fill the SLT trampoline table with symbol table indices
    (1) Add function multiplicity information to the executable. Create a dict
        that maps every global symbol to a pair of (shared lib, multiplicity)
    (1) Overwrite the PLT entries to have an indirect CALL. Only do this for 
        PLT entries that jump to CDI shared libraries. To get the shared library 
        of a PLT given, use the global symbol dict created for multiplicity counting
        In order to do this, the symbol of each PLT entry must be known: get the 
        symbols from PLT relocations, as is done below for associating PLT
        calls with RLT entries.
    (1) Associate PLT entry return addresses with RLT entries. Use PLT relocs
        to identify the symbol name. Then use symbol name to get the RLT entry
        by looking through the symbol table
    (4) Overwrite shared lib PLT entries to jump down to an unshared PLT

RTLD
    (1) identify the cdi metadata added onto each shared lib
    (1) for each shared lib, calculate the extra space needed for the SLT
    (1) mmap extra space for the SLT
    (1) build the SLTs by iterating through the SLT trampoline. Each SLT 
        has an associated symbol name, which can be used with the symtab hash
        table to get RLT entries. Check each code object if it has an RLT entry
        until the multiplicity is satisfied. Each RLT entry will have an associated
        PLT return address which should be used to validate jumps in SLTs
    (2) Modify verifier to work with segments, SLTs, RLTs, and modified PLTs
    (4) Fixup unshared PLT entries to be direct using the global offset table

CDI ELF Extension Format:
    .cdi_header
    .cdi_sshtab
    [subsection 1]
    [subsection 2]
        ...
    [subsection N]

Think of the CDI elf extension as a section. Naturally, it is then composed of 
subsections, which are listed in its subsection header table (.cdi_sshtab). 
The .cdi_header and .cdi_sshtab subsections must be placed at the beginning 
of the CDI elf extension (and in that order).

current subsections in use
    .cdi_header: general info about the CDI metadata
    .cdi_sshtab: a table containing info on each subsection
    .cdi_strtab: a string table for CDI use only. Has the same format as strtab
    .cdi_mult: contains info for calculating SLT size at load time

=========================================================================
Subsection .cdi_header

typedef struct {
    Elf64_Word cdi_ident;
    Elf64_Word num_sshdrs;
} ELF64_CDI_header

cdi_ident: an identifier used to mark the remaining file as CDI metadata
num_sshdrs: the number of subsection headers in the .cdi_sshtab subsection
sshtab_addr: gives the address of the first byte of the .cdi_sshtab subsection

=========================================================================
Subsection .cdi_sshtab

typedef struct {
    Elf64_Word ssh_name;
    Elf64_Word ssh_size;
    Elf64_Word ssh_addr;
    Elf64_Half ssh_type;
    unsigned char ssh_align;
    unsigned char unused;
} Elf64_CDI_Sshdr

ssh_name: an index into the cdi_strtab
ssh_size: the section's size in bytes
ssh_addr: the address at which the subsection's first byte should reside
ssh_type: categorizes the type of CDI subsection see below for a table
ssh_align: indicates that this subsection needs to be aligned by a certain power
           of two bytes. It is calculated as (1 << ssh_align). ssh_align must be
           smaller than or equal to six

ssh_type | Meaning
---------+---------------
0        | No type 
1        | cdi strtab subsection
2        | multiplicity subsection
< 2^16   | undefined

=========================================================================
Subsection .cdi_mult

typedef struct {
    Elf64_Word soname;
    Elf64_Word total_multiplicity;
    Elf64_Word num_global_syms;
    Elf64_Word unused;
    typedef struct {
        Elf64_Word sym_name;
        Elf64_Word multiplicity;
    } Elf64_CDI_Sym_Mult[num_global_syms];
} Elf64_CDI_Multtab[NUM_SHARED_LIBS]

soname: contains an index into the CDI string table for the shared library's soname
total_multiplicity: the total multiplicity of all global symbols for this shared library
num_global_syms: the total number of global symbols in this shared library
sym_name: an index into the cdi_strtab
multiplicity: The number of distinct code objects that call sym_name. Code objects
              include the executable and any shared libraries. A call to sym_name
              from within its own shared library is counted in the multiplicity.
              The multiplicity is used to construct the size of the SLT

The ELF64_CDI_Sym_Mult array must be ordered identically to the SLT trampoline
in each shared library. This can be accomplished by iterating through the SLT
trampoline info array and adding each (symbol, multiplicity) pair one after another.

This subsection is only needed for shared libraries since it's only purpose is 
to facilitate calculating the SLT size at load time. Executables do not have an 
SLT since shared libraries cannot call into an executable without using a function
pointer.

Because this subsection incorporates relationships between the 
shared libraries and the executable, this subsection must only be present
in an executable. Shared libraries have no way of knowing all the other shared
libraries with which they can be associated with.
