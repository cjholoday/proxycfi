Timeline:
    1. calls into "basic" shared libraries work. "basic" shared libraries
       do not have function pointer calls. 
    2. The verifier is run after the loader is finished
    3. Function pointer call support added for shared libraries
    4. PLT entries are fixed up at load time so that the calls are direct

Responsibilities
----------------
converter
    (1) Generate a dummy SLT trampoline. Entries contain a relative jump back 
        to the function they are serving. This allows us to associate symbols
        with trampoline entries. The trampolines will be changed to point to 
        SLT entries at load time
    (1) Generate an empty trampoline info table that is an array corresponding 
        to the SLT trampoline table. Each array element will eventually be filled
        with the symbol table index of the trampoline's associated symbol. For now,
        the array elements are left empty until cdi-ld fills them in
    (3) expand the SLT trampoline to hold entries for fptr sleds. 
    (3) Create a .typestrtab section, which has its types lexicographically sorted

cdi-ld
    (1) Fill the SLT trampoline info table with symbol table indices
    (1) Add function multiplicity information to the executable
    (1) Overwrite the PLT entries to have an indirect CALL
    (4) Overwrite shared lib PLT entries to jump down to an unshared PLT

rtld
    (1) identify the cdi metadata added onto each shared lib
    (1) for each shared lib, calculate the extra space needed for the SLT
    (1) mmap extra space for the SLT
    (1) build the SLTs by iterating through the SLT trampoline. Each SLT 
        has an associated symbol name, which can be used with the symtab hash
        table to get RLT entries. Check each code object if it has an RLT entry
        until the multiplicity is satisfied. Each RLT entry will have an associated
        PLT return address which should be used to validate jumps in SLTs
    (2) Modify verifier to work with segments, SLTs, RLTs, and modified PLTs
    (3) 
    (4) Fixup unshared PLT entries to be direct using the global offset table

unassigned
    (1) Associate PLT entry return addresses with RLT entries
